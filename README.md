## üî® Project features

A very responsive pokedex that allows you to browse all generation 5 pokemons.

It contains detailed information about each Pok√©mon, such as its name, number in order of registration, type, abilities, battle stats, possible evolutions, location where it can be found, and other characteristics.

App Pokedex is an application for pokemons consultation, developed from the tutorial [Manual do Dev](https://www.youtube.com/@ManualdoDev). The main idea behind the implementation of this tutorial is to further evolve pure knowledge in js, html and css bases. It is a project that I highly recommend running.
