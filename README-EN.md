# App Pokedex

A responsive [pokédex](https://pokemon.fandom.com/pt-br/wiki/Pok%C3%A9dex) that lets you browse all generation 5 pokemons.



## 🔨 Project features

A Pokedex is an electronic device featured in the Pokémon game and anime series that serves as a digital encyclopedia for all known species of Pokémon. In this reinterpretation, a pokedex with a layout very close to the original was made, where you can browse between the pokemons of generation 5.

## ⚙️ Techniques and technologies used

Check out this list of everything we will use in this app:

## 🛠️ Open and run the project

To open and run the project, run `npm i` to install the dependencies and `npm run dev` to start the project.

## 📚 More tutorial information

The App Pokedex is an application for consulting pokemons, developed from the tutorial [Manual do Dev](https://www.youtube.com/@ManualdoDev). The main idea behind the implementation of this tutorial is to further evolve pure knowledge in js, html and css bases. It's a project I recommend for beginners to deal with fetch, DOM manipulation and object access.
